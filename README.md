# wediy Tech Test - Mobile Engineer
## Background
One of the core components of the wediy applications is a chat interface to facilitate communication between the different stakeholders on a project.

## The Task
Your task is to replicate the popular Facebook Messenger chat interface (see screenshot below).  I have also provided a file containing an arbitrary set of sentences that should be used to make up the conversation.  The interface should be performant when scrolling backwards and forwards through the conversation history.  Do your best to match the UI as closely as you can, but don’t stress too much if it isn’t perfect.  Also, the buttons on the title bar and keyboard accessory do not have to function as they do on Messenger, just the placement and styling is enough.

Please plan to spend no more than 4 hours on this task.
